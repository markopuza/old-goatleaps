*Haar* (or sea fret) is a pretty Scotland-specific term for a particular type of a sea fog. It is to be seen commonly near the east coast of Scotland and England, between spring and autumn. Haar forms above the sea, when the warm air passes above the relatively colder North Sea, and is subsequently blown by the wind to the land.

The most beautiful and sunny days around here are sometimes ruined by haar. When it engulfs the city, it brings the impression of a gloomy, rainy and overcast day, no matter the weather forecast promising crystal clear skies. But putting this aside, it creates the *most unique* and beautiful sceneries. Below is a >>[cinemagraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cinemagraph)<< of haar flowing over the Edinburgh's landmarks, as well as a few other photographs.
