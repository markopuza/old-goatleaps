# WARNING: The text below provides a guidance for a Project Euler problem.

- If you pride yourself in tackling problems entirely on your own, you are encouraged to exit this post right now.

- If you are simply looking for a hint for the problem, please visit the >>[Project Euler's official forum](https://projecteuler.chat/index.php)<<. You may find some hints here, but if you don't want your problem spoiled, scroll cautiously.

- If you are looking for a readily available copy/paste answer, you will not find it here. __All of the code snippets in the post have been stripped of some crucial lines__ (these are clearly marked). It is my aim that anyone able to replicate the answer based on such snippets will have to understand the solution conceptually. At that point, by virtue of learning something new, I believe he deserves it anyway.

- *Guidance for future problems will not be published before 100 people have solved the problem **and** there are at least two more recent problems*.
